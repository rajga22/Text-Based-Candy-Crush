Text-Based Candy Crush in Java
This project is a simple Java implementation of the popular game Candy Crush. It is entirely text-based and runs in the console. The game includes basic mechanics like candy swapping, matching, scoring.

Features
8x8 Game Grid: The grid is populated with a random assortment of candy types.
Candy Types: Five different types of candies are represented by the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'.
Scoring System: Players earn points for each set of candies matched. The score increases based on the number of candies matched.
Adjacent Swap: Players can swap two adjacent candies to create a match of three or more similar candies.
How to Play
The game grid will display upon starting the game.
You will be prompted to enter the row and column of the first candy you wish to swap.
Next, you will enter the row and column of the second adjacent candy you want to swap.
If a valid match of three or more identical candies is made, they will be cleared from the board, and your score will increase.
The game continues indefinitely. Make strategic swaps to maximize your score!
